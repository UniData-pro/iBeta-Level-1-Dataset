# iBeta Level 1 Dataset: Facial Liveness Detection and Anti-Spoofing
### Dataset for iBeta Level 1 certification (ISO 30107-3 standard), pad tests for liveness detection
The dataset consists of more than **28,800** video attacks of **7** different types specifically curated for a passing **iBeta Level 1** and getting a certification. It is compliant with the **ISO 30107-3** standard, which sets the highest quality requirements for biometric testing and attack detection. 
By geting the **iBeta Level 1 certification**, biometric technology companies demonstrate their commitment to developing robust and reliable biometric systems that can effectively detect and prevent fraud -

This dataset is designed to evaluate the performance of face recognition and authentication systems in detecting presentation attacks, it includes different pad tests.
Each attack was filmed on an **Apple iPhone** and **Google Pixel**.
1. **2D Mask**: printed photos of people cut out along the contour
2. **Wrapped 2D Mask**: printed photos of people attached to a cylinder
3. **2D Mask with Eyeholes**: printed photos of people with holes for eyes
4. **3D Mask**: portraits consisting of several connected cardboard masks
5. **Smartphone Replay**: a person's photo demonstrated on a phone screen
6. **PC Replay**: a person's photo demonstrated on a computer screen
7. **Real Person**: real videos of people
